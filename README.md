# Flipper CLI Agent Buddy

Turn your Flipper Zero into a physical companion for **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex**, and **Cursor** CLI agents. Get tactile feedback for every AI action, see which agent is connected at a glance, and control your terminal session with real buttons instead of typing.

> Supports macOS and Linux. Windows is not tested.

## What it does

**You feel what the agent is doing.**
Every significant event triggers a distinct sound and vibration pattern on your Flipper, so you always know status even when you are not looking at the screen.

**You see which agent is active.**
The status header shows **Claude**, **Codex**, or **Cursor** in the top-left corner when a host bridge is connected.

**You control the agent with physical buttons.**
Interrupt a runaway task, submit a prompt, trigger voice dictation, or open the command menu — all without touching the keyboard.

**The character reacts to context.**
Animations and optional Ctx/Lim meters reflect tool use, compaction, permission outcomes, and context pressure.

## Supported agents

| Agent | Package | Install doc | IPC socket |
|-------|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Claude Code** | `plugin/` | [Setup below](#claude-code) | `/tmp/claude-flipper-bridge.sock` |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `flipper-codex-buddy/` | [Codex README](flipper-codex-buddy/README.md) | `/tmp/codex-flipper-bridge.sock` |
| **Cursor** | `flipper-cursor-buddy/` | [Cursor README](flipper-cursor-buddy/README.md) | `/tmp/cursor-flipper-bridge.sock` |
| **Claude Desktop** | *(none — built into FAP)* | [Desktop mode](#claude-desktop-ble) | BLE only |

Each CLI agent ships its own hook scripts and Python host bridge. All bridges share the same Flipper application and serial protocol.

> **Important:** Only one bridge should use the Flipper USB serial port at a time. Stop or disable other bridges before switching agents.

## Flipper app modes

Claude Buddy runs in one of two transport modes, switchable from the on-device menu (long-press **Right → MENU**, then the top row):

- **Claude Code (USB/BLE)** (default) — pairs with a CLI agent through a host bridge over USB or BLE. Full keystroke forwarding: Enter, Esc, voice dictation, command menu, etc.
- **Claude Desktop (BLE)** — talks directly to the Claude Desktop app over Anthropic's [Hardware Buddy](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-desktop-buddy) protocol. No plugin, no host bridge. Live session status, token counts, transcript, and on-device permission prompts.

See [flipper-app/README.md](flipper-app/README.md) for the full button map and mode details.

## Buttons

| Button | Action (Bridge mode) |
|--------|----------------------|
| UP | Start / stop voice dictation |
| UP (hold) | Hold Space for voice input |
| LEFT | Interrupt (Esc) |
| LEFT (hold) | Send Ctrl+C |
| RIGHT | Open command menu |
| RIGHT (hold) | Open info menu |
| OK | Submit Enter |
| OK (hold) | Type "yes" and submit |
| DOWN | Send Down arrow |
| DOWN (hold) | Toggle mute |
| BACK | Send Backspace |
| BACK (hold) | Exit |

## Setup

### 1. Install the Flipper app

Download `claude_buddy.fap` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest) or build from source:

```bash
cd flipper-app && ufbt build
# Flash to a connected device (stop any running bridge first):
ufbt launch
```

Copy the `.fap` to `apps/USB/` on the SD card, or flash via `ufbt launch`.

Launch **Applications → USB → Claude Buddy** on the Flipper. You should hear the startup fanfare when the transport connects.

### 2. Pick your CLI agent

#### Claude Code

> **Requires Python 3.10+.**

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add jxw1102/flipper-claude-buddy
claude plugin install flipper-claude-buddy@flipper-claude-buddy
```

The plugin starts the host bridge automatically on each Claude Code session. Configure transport in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `pluginConfigs → flipper-claude-buddy → options`:

```json
{
  "transport": "ble",           // "auto", "usb", or "ble"
  "bluetoothName": "Omachal"   // your Flipper's BLE name (required for BLE)
}
```

**Running the bridge manually** (for testing or standalone use):

```bash
cd plugin/host-bridge
pip3 install -e ".[bt]"
python3 -m bridge --transport ble --flipper "Omachal" --log-level info
```

Use `--flipper` or the `FLIPPER_BT_NAME` env var when your Flipper has a custom BLE name.

#### OpenAI Codex

```bash
./flipper-codex-buddy/scripts/install-codex-plugin.sh
```

Then open `/hooks` in Codex, trust the plugin hooks, and start a new thread. See [flipper-codex-buddy/README.md](flipper-codex-buddy/README.md).

#### Cursor

```bash
chmod +x flipper-cursor-buddy/scripts/install-cursor-hooks.sh
./flipper-cursor-buddy/scripts/install-cursor-hooks.sh
```

Open **Settings → Hooks** in Cursor, confirm hooks are loaded, and start a new agent session. See [flipper-cursor-buddy/README.md](flipper-cursor-buddy/README.md).

### Claude Desktop (BLE)

1. On the Flipper, switch to **Claude Desktop (BLE)** in the info menu.
2. In Claude Desktop: **Help → Troubleshooting → Enable Developer Mode**.
3. **Developer → Open Hardware Buddy** and select your Flipper. Grant Bluetooth permission on first connect.

Once paired, Claude Desktop auto-reconnects when both sides are online.

## Connection

CLI bridges connect over USB (plug-and-play) or Bluetooth LE. USB is preferred when the cable is plugged in; bridges fall back to BLE automatically when configured for `auto`.

**Bridge CLI arguments:**

```text
python3 -m bridge [--transport auto|usb|ble] [--flipper NAME] [--log-level debug|info|warning|error]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--transport` | `auto` | Transport to use: `auto` (USB first, fallback BLE), `usb`, or `ble` |
| `--flipper` | *(env: `FLIPPER_BT_NAME`)* | BLE device name — overrides the scan prefix from "Flipper" to your device's name |
| `--log-level` | `info` | Log verbosity. Use `debug` for diagnosing BLE connection issues |

**macOS — Bluetooth pairing:** accept the pairing prompt on first BLE connect. If pairing fails after a firmware flash, remove the Flipper from System Settings → Bluetooth and re-pair.

**macOS — Accessibility (keystroke forwarding):** grant your terminal app Accessibility permission in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility. Without it, status updates work but button presses do nothing.

**Linux — USB:** Flipper appears as `/dev/ttyACM*`. Add your user to `dialout` if you get permission errors:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER   # log out and back in
export FLIPPER_TRANSPORT=usb     # recommended on Linux
```

**Linux — Keystroke forwarding:**

| Display server | Tool | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Wayland (GNOME, KDE, Sway, …) | `ydotool` | `sudo apt install ydotool ydotoold` |
| Wayland (wlroots: Sway, Hyprland) | `wtype` | `sudo apt install wtype` |
| X11 | `xdotool` | `sudo apt install xdotool` |

**Wayland users:** start the `ydotoold` daemon before running the bridge:
```bash
sudo ydotoold &
```
The daemon must stay running while the bridge is active. On Wayland the terminal window must have keyboard focus — programmatic window focusing is not available.

**Linux — BLE:** functional via BlueZ (the `bleak` library). USB is preferred for reliability.

**Requirements:**
- **BlueZ ≥ 5.72** (check with `bluetoothctl --version`). Older versions don't support the `--agent` flag needed for automated pairing.
- **Bluetooth powered on:** `bluetoothctl power on`
- **Flipper advertising:** launch Claude Buddy on the Flipper; the app advertises the bridge serial service (UUID `0x3082`).

**BLUETOOTH PAIRING IS NOT REQUIRED.** The Flipper app uses a non-authenticated BLE serial profile that allows GATT access without pairing. This avoids complex BlueZ agent management.

**Custom device name:** If your Flipper has been renamed from the default "Flipper", specify the name explicitly:

```bash
# Via CLI flag:
python3 -m bridge --transport ble --flipper "Omachal"

# Or via environment variable:
FLIPPER_BT_NAME="Omachal" python3 -m bridge --transport ble
```

When running through the Claude Code plugin, set the name in `~/.claude/settings.json` (`bluetoothName` option under `flipper-claude-buddy`).

## Host identification protocol

Bridges report which agent is connected via the `host` field on `state` messages:

```json
{"v":1,"t":"state","d":{"claude":true,"host":"cursor"}}
```

Allowed values: `claude`, `codex`, `cursor`. The Flipper shows the label in the status header. Older bridges without `host` still work; Desktop BLE mode defaults to **Claude**.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Flipper not found over USB | Stop other bridges and apps using the serial port (qFlipper, another agent bridge). Set `FLIPPER_SERIAL_PORT` explicitly. |
| Flipper not found over BLE | Ensure Bluetooth is on (`bluetoothctl power on`). The Flipper must be running Claude Buddy and in Bridge mode. Check the BLE device name matches `--flipper` / `FLIPPER_BT_NAME`. |
| BLE connection fails with `AuthenticationFailed` | You are running an older version of the Flipper app. Rebuild with `ufbt build && ufbt launch` — the latest `bridge_profile.c` uses non-authenticated characteristics. |
| BLE connection fails with `org.bluez.Error` | Ensure BlueZ ≥ 5.72. If pairing is required, run `bluetoothctl --agent NoInputNoOutput` and `pair <MAC>` manually, then restart the bridge. |
| Bridge connects but Flipper buttons do nothing (BLE) | Update the Flipper app — an older build may have a race in `transport_bt.c` where `bt_set_status_changed_callback` was registered after advertising, causing `bt->connected` to stay `false`. Rebuild with `ufbt build && ufbt launch`. |
| Bridge manual session: Flipper connects but no Claude interaction | Send `claude_connect` via IPC: `echo '{"action":"claude_connect","project_dir":"'$(pwd)'"}' \| nc -U /tmp/<agent>-flipper-bridge.sock`. When running through the plugin, this is handled automatically by `on-session-start.sh`. |
| Wrong agent label / no label | Restart the bridge after flashing a new FAP. Ensure the bridge sends `host` in `state` messages. |
| No sound on task complete | Check bridge log: `tail -f /tmp/<agent>-flipper-bridge.log` |
| Buttons do nothing (macOS) | Grant Accessibility permission to your terminal app. |
| Buttons do nothing (Linux X11) | Install `xdotool`; focus the terminal window. |
| Buttons do nothing (Linux Wayland) | Install `ydotool` + `ydotoold`; start the daemon with `sudo ydotoold &`; keep the terminal focused. |
| Parse errors / CLI banner in log | The Flipper is running the CLI app, not Claude Buddy — open the buddy FAP and restart the bridge. |

Bridge logs:

| Agent | Log file |
|-------|----------|
| Claude Code | `/tmp/claude-flipper-bridge.log` |
| Codex | `/tmp/codex-flipper-bridge.log` |
| Cursor | `/tmp/cursor-flipper-bridge.log` |
